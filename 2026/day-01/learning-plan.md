**90-Day Personal DevOps Learning Plan**

**Introduction and Current Level**
I’m Omkar Mahamuni, a working professional with 4.6 years of experience as an SDET, with a keen interest in transitioning to DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

**Why Start with DevOps & Cloud**
I am beginning my journey in DevOps and Cloud to enhance my skill set, stay relevant in the evolving tech landscape, and open new career opportunities in cloud-native technologies and infrastructure management.

**Understanding DevOps**
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking ways to deliver high-quality software faster and more efficiently. This is where DevOps comes into play. DevOps is not just a buzzword; it is a cultural and transformative approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to streamline and automate software delivery, enhance collaboration, and drive continuous improvement.

**Learning DevOps & Cloud**
Over the next 90 days, I will focus on consistent hands-on practice with open-source tools such as Linux, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, because real-world experience matters more than theory. I will build projects and document them through blogs or GitHub, making my problem-solving process visible. Each day, I will study both core topics (Linux, networking, scripting) and advanced areas (infrastructure as code, observability, security). I will keep my LinkedIn and GitHub active to share insights, projects, and engage with the community, strengthening my professional presence. I will prepare with mock interviews and scenario-based questions to sharpen my ability to handle real-world challenges confidently. By combining practice, documentation, learning, visibility, and interview preparation, I will establish a strong foundation for my DevOps career.

**Goals**
To learn DevOps and Cloud technologies. To enhance my skill set and stay relevant in the evolving tech landscape. To open new career opportunities in cloud-native technologies and infrastructure management.

**Weekly Time Budget**
Weekdays: 2 hours per day dedicated to learning and practicing DevOps.
Weekends: 5 to 6 hours of focused study and project work.
Perform assignments daily and create blogs or LinkedIn posts for documentation purposes.
